# RecipeApp

## About
Application for webscraping recipies and storing them in SQLite database. This was a side project for me to improve my webscraping skill outside of python and practice database creation and access.

## Whats done

Web Scraping from AllRecipes and storage into SQLite database.

## Future

In the future I may or may not add the following functionality:

- Add additional parsers (e.g. https://www.epicurious.com/, generic recipie parser)
- Front end for viewing
- Shopping list extraction
- meal planning
